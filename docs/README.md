## Sections

### [adr/](./adr/README.md)
Architecture Decision Records documenting significant technical decisions with context, rationale, and consequences. Consult these to understand *why* the system is designed the way it is and what alternatives were considered.

### [architecture/](./architecture/)
In-depth documentation for cross-cutting architectural concerns like authentication, real-time event streaming, and integration patterns between components.

### [refactoring/](./refactoring/README.md)
Refactoring proposals, consistency fixes, and technical improvements. These are tracked tasks that improve code and documentation quality without adding new features.

### [design/](./design/README.md)
Feature specifications and detailed designs for planned capabilities. Documents here represent work in planning or early development stages.

### [features/](./features/README.md)
Documentation for implemented features including Executor Profiles, Runner Gateway, Capabilities System, and Agent Management. Each document explains what a feature does, why it exists, and how it works.

### [setup/](./setup/)
Deployment and configuration guides for external services and infrastructure dependencies.

### [reference/](./reference/)
Quick-reference documentation for schemas, formats, and specifications used across the system.

## Component Documentation

### [components/](./components/)
Technical reference documentation for individual services and applications. Each component has its own folder with API docs, data models, and implementation details.
