## Key Message

Real teams are distributed - different people, different machines, different expertise. Why should the agent system be centralized? Let everyone contribute agents to a shared network.

**The problem it solves:** Centralized agent systems don't match how teams actually work. One person controls everything; others can only use, not contribute.

**The solution:** Agent runners on different machines contribute to a shared orchestrator. Each team member brings their expertise.

## Diagram Description

**Visual: Distributed Team Network**

Show a central coordinator with distributed contributors:

**Center: "Shared Orchestrator"**
- Agent Coordinator box
- Connected to a "Knowledge Base" below it

**Around it: Team Members with Runners**

- **Developer's Machine:**
  - Runner box
  - Provides: "Code Agent", "Test Agent"

- **Designer's Machine:**
  - Runner box
  - Provides: "Design Review Agent"

- **PM's Machine:**
  - Runner box
  - Provides: "Requirements Agent"

All runners connect to the central coordinator. Agents from all sources can collaborate.

The visual should convey: "Different people, different agents, one system."

## The Long-term Vision

A unified knowledge hub where all project disciplines contribute:
- **Programmers** build capabilities (MCP servers, skills)
- **Domain experts** describe agents and requirements
- **Everyone** can access and benefit

Not just for programmers - accessible to designers, PMs, product owners.

## Talking Points

- "This is where we're heading"
- "Imagine: your expertise, your agents, shared with the team"
- "The framework enables it; the culture adopts it"
