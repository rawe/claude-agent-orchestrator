## Key Message

Stop rebuilding infrastructure for every project. Agent Orchestrator provides the core - orchestration, execution, monitoring - so teams can focus on their specific use case.

**The problem it solves:** Every agentic tool needs the same building blocks. Without a foundation, each team reinvents them.

**The solution:** A shared core that handles the common parts. Build your agents on top.

## Diagram Description

**Visual: Layered Architecture**

Show a two-layer stack:

**Top Layer: "Your Agents"**
- Multiple boxes representing team-specific agents
- Examples: "Knowledge Agent", "Research Agent", "Support Agent"
- These look unique, colorful, varied

**Bottom Layer: "Agent Orchestrator Core"**
- A solid foundation bar
- Contains: Coordinator, Runners, Monitoring, State
- Looks stable, uniform, foundational

Arrows show the agents building ON TOP of the core.

The visual should convey: "You focus on the top layer, we handle the bottom."
