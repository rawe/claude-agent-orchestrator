## Key Message

Building agentic tools means solving the same problems over and over:

- **Infrastructure overhead:** Orchestration, execution, monitoring - rebuilt for every project
- **Coordination:** How do agents work together without stepping on each other?
- **Context:** How do they share the right information at the right time?
- **The AI-Program gap:** AI is flexible but slow; programs are fast but rigid. No clean way to combine them.
- **Accessibility:** Currently only programmers can build and contribute agents

Yes, agentic frameworks exist (LangChain, AutoGen, etc.) - but they're generic, opinionated, and still require deep programming knowledge. They solve some infrastructure, but the real challenges remain.

**We spend more time wiring things together than on what agents actually do.**

## Diagram Description

**Visual: Challenges as Barriers**

Show the 5 challenges as obstacles/barriers:
- Infrastructure
- Coordination
- Context
- AI-Program Gap
- Accessibility

A small "Agent Work" area squeezed between all these barriers.

Visual message: the actual work gets lost in the problems surrounding it.

## Talking Points

- "Sound familiar? We've all been there."
- "Frameworks help, but don't solve these core challenges"
- "The real work gets buried"
