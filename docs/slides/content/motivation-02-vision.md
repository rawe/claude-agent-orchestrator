## Key Message

A reusable foundation for building agentic tools - so we can focus on solving problems, not rebuilding infrastructure.

**One sentence:** Build agents once, orchestrate them together, let everyone contribute.

## The Eight Pillars

Each pillar is clickable and leads to a detailed explanation.

| Pillar | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Reusable Foundation** | Don't start from scratch | Implemented |
| **Progressive Refinement** | Start simple, specialize iteratively | Implemented |
| **Hybrid Execution** | Bridge AI and deterministic agents | Next Priority |
| **Context Engineering** | Right information at the right time | Implemented |
| **Clean Interfaces** | Easy to connect, easy to adapt | Implemented |
| **Provider Independence** | No vendor lock-in | Implemented |
| **Everyone Can Contribute** | Not just for programmers | Implemented |
| **Decentralized Collaboration** | Team members contribute agents | Early Vision |

## Diagram Description

**Visual: Eight Pillar Cards in Two Rows**

Show the 8 pillars as clickable cards in a 4+4 grid (two rows):

**Row 1 (4 cards):**
- Reusable Foundation
- Progressive Refinement
- Hybrid Execution
- Context Engineering

**Row 2 (4 cards):**
- Clean Interfaces
- Provider Independence
- Everyone Can Contribute (deep dive)
- Decentralized Collaboration

Each card has: icon, title, short description, status badge
Cards should look interactive (hover effect)
Status badges: checkmark for implemented, arrow for next priority, diamond for vision
"Everyone Can Contribute" links to a deep dive slide (motivation-10-accessibility)

The visual should feel: organized, interactive, inviting exploration.

## Talking Points

- "These are the eight pillars we're building"
- "Click any card to dive deeper"
- "Green checkmarks are done, the arrow shows our current focus"
