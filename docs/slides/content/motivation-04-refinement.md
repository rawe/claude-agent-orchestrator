## Key Message

Start with a simple agent that "does everything." Then, iteratively break it down into specialized, orchestrated agents. This is a process for refining ideas - not just running them.

**The problem it solves:** Monolithic agents become hard to maintain, debug, and improve. You can't see what's failing or why.

**The solution:** A natural evolution path. Start broad, go deep where needed.

## Diagram Description

**Visual: Evolution Flow**

Show a progression from left to right:

**Stage 1 (Left): "Monolithic"**
- One large box: "Agent that does everything"
- Looks bulky, complex

**Arrow in the middle:** "Refine"

**Stage 2 (Right): "Orchestrated Specialists"**
- An "Orchestrator" box at the top
- Three smaller, focused boxes below: "Research", "Analysis", "Writing"
- Clean lines connecting them

The visual should show: simplification through specialization.

## The Refinement Journey

1. Start with a simple, high-level agent
2. Observe where it struggles
3. Extract that capability into a specialist
4. Orchestrate the specialists together
5. Repeat
