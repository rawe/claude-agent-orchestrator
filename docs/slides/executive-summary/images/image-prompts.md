## Option 1: "The Overwhelmed Solo Agent"

**Title:** "This Is What We're Building Today"

**Prompt:**

```
A single humanoid robot standing in the center, visibly stressed and overwhelmed. The robot has a sleek, modern design with glowing purple (#8b5cf6) accents representing AI. Around the robot, 15-20 floating holographic task panels are swirling chaotically - some showing code, some showing documents, some showing error messages, some showing loading spinners. The robot has multiple mechanical arms trying to reach in different directions but failing to grasp everything. Sparks and small warning icons float around its head. Papers and digital fragments are scattered in mid-air.

Style: Clean, minimalist 3D render with soft lighting. Dark background (#0a0f1a) with subtle blue (#3b82f6) and purple (#8b5cf6) ambient glow at the edges. Isometric or slightly angled perspective. Modern tech aesthetic, no text on the image. The mood should feel chaotic but professional, not cartoonish.
```

## Option 2: "The Reinvention Tax"

**Title:** "Every AI Project Starts Here... Again"

**Prompt:**

```
An abstract 3D visualization of a pie chart or circular diagram floating in space. The largest segment (approximately 70%) glows in muted grey (#94a3b8) representing "infrastructure overhead". A small segment (10%) glows brightly in vibrant purple (#8b5cf6) representing "actual innovation". The chart has a transparent, glass-like quality with internal glow effects.

Around the chart, floating semi-transparent blueprints and technical diagrams fade into the darkness, representing repeated work. Small glowing nodes connect the segments with thin cyan (#06b6d4) lines.

Style: Dark background (#0a0f1a) with subtle radial gradient of blue (#3b82f6) at top-left corner. Clean, modern, data-visualization aesthetic. Soft shadows and reflections. The small purple segment should draw the eye as the brightest element. No text.
```

## Option 3: "The False Choice"

**Title:** "Pick One. Lose Something."

**Prompt:**

```
Two glowing doorways or portals floating in a dark void, positioned on the left and right sides of the frame.

Left door: Emits a soft purple (#8b5cf6) glow, with abstract neural network patterns and flowing, organic light streams emanating from it. Represents AI - beautiful but complex.

Right door: Emits an orange (#f97316) glow, with rigid geometric patterns, straight lines, and code-like grid structures. Represents automation - structured but rigid.

In the center between the doors: A subtle silhouette of a person (or abstract human form made of light points) standing still, facing forward, caught between the two choices. The figure is rendered in light grey (#f1f5f9).

Style: Dark background (#0a0f1a) with the two glows creating a split-tone effect. Cinematic, moody atmosphere. The space between the doors should feel like a void - the "impossible middle ground". Modern, abstract, slightly surreal. No text.
```

## Option 4: "The POC Graveyard"

**Title:** "Where AI Projects Go to Die"

**Prompt:**

```
A visual progression showing three stages from left to right:

LEFT: A small, bright glowing cube or gem in vibrant green (#10b981), floating above an open laptop. Energy and light particles emanate from it - representing a successful proof of concept. Bright and hopeful.

CENTER: The same shape, now larger and more complex, with orange (#f59e0b) warning symbols and hairline cracks appearing. It's hovering above server racks, slightly unstable, with some particles falling off.

RIGHT: A crumbled, fractured version of the shape, now grey and dim, resting on the ground with pieces scattered around it. A subtle tombstone silhouette or broken monument shape in the background. Purple (#8b5cf6) ghost-like wisps rising from it.

Style: Dark background (#0a0f1a) with a subtle gradient. The progression should read naturally left-to-right as a timeline. Clean 3D render, modern tech aesthetic. The mood shifts from hopeful to cautionary. Dramatic but professional lighting. No text.
```

## Option 5: "The Evolution Question"

**Title:** "Your AI Today vs. Your AI Tomorrow"

**Prompt:**

```
A split-screen composition:

LEFT HALF: A single large monolithic cube or block, glowing purple (#8b5cf6), with dense, tangled internal circuitry visible through semi-transparent walls. It looks heavy, dense, bottlenecked. A few thin lines try to exit but get congested.

RIGHT HALF: An elegant organizational structure - a central orchestrator node (green #10b981 glow) at the top, connected by clean flowing lines (cyan #06b6d4) to 5-6 smaller specialized nodes below (purple #8b5cf6 and orange #f97316 mix). Each smaller node is focused, clean, with clear inputs and outputs. The structure resembles a neural network or org chart.

CENTER: A large, semi-transparent question mark or transformation arrow connecting the two sides, rendered in blue (#3b82f6) with a subtle glow effect.

Style: Dark background (#0a0f1a). Clean, schematic visualization style with soft glows and shadows. The right side should feel clearly superior - organized, elegant, parallel. Modern tech aesthetic. No text.
```

## Option 6: "The Team Metaphor" (Recommended)

**Title:** "One AI is Good. A Team is Better."

**Prompt:**

```
A dramatic side-by-side comparison:

LEFT SIDE: A single humanoid robot in the center, overwhelmed. It has 6-8 mechanical arms stretched in all directions, each trying to handle a different glowing task orb. The robot's body shows strain - overheating indicators, sparks, warning lights. Task orbs are colliding, some falling. The scene feels chaotic. Purple (#8b5cf6) glow dominates. The robot stands alone on a small platform.

RIGHT SIDE: A conductor-style robot stands calmly on an elevated platform at the top, with a green (#10b981) glow. Below it, arranged in a clean semi-circle, are 5 specialized robots - each smaller, each with a single purpose, each handling one task orb expertly. One robot is purple (#8b5cf6) for analysis, one orange (#f97316) for automation, one cyan (#06b6d4) for data, etc. Clean flowing lines connect the conductor to each specialist. All task orbs are under control, neatly positioned.

The two scenes should be clearly separated but in the same image frame.

Style: Dark background (#0a0f1a) with subtle blue and purple radial gradients. Clean, modern 3D render. Isometric or slightly elevated perspective. The contrast should be immediately obvious - chaos vs. harmony, overwhelm vs. orchestration. Professional, not cartoonish. No text on the image.
```

## Option 6 Alternative: Abstract/Minimal Version

**Title:** "One AI is Good. A Team is Better."

**Prompt:**

```
A minimalist split composition on a dark background (#0a0f1a):

LEFT: A single bright purple (#8b5cf6) glowing sphere in the center with 12+ thin tangled lines emanating chaotically in all directions, some lines crossing and knotting, ends frayed and scattered. The sphere pulses with an overloaded energy.

RIGHT: A calm green (#10b981) glowing sphere at the top center, with 5 clean, organized lines flowing downward to 5 smaller spheres arranged in a gentle arc below (colored purple #8b5cf6, orange #f97316, cyan #06b6d4, blue #3b82f6, and amber #f59e0b). Each smaller sphere has 2-3 neat output lines. Everything is balanced and harmonious.

A subtle dividing line or gradient separates the two halves.

Style: Abstract, geometric, modern data visualization aesthetic. Soft glows and light bloom effects. Clean and professional. The right side should feel like the obvious evolution. Dark background with subtle blue radial glow in top-left corner. No text.
