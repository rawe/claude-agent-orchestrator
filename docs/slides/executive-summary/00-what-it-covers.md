# Slide 0: What the Framework Covers

## Title
**"Six Pillars of Intelligent Automation"**

## Subtitle
"Everything you need to build, run, and scale AI-powered solutions"

## Key Message
This framework isn't just one thing—it's a complete foundation. Six integrated capabilities that work together, so you can focus on value, not infrastructure.

---

## The Six Pillars

### 1. Define — Agent Blueprints

**Icon idea:** Document / notepad / pencil

**Message:** Describe what agents do in plain language—anyone can contribute.

**Why it matters:**
- No coding required to define agent behavior
- Product managers write prompts, not developers
- Change agent behavior by editing text files
- Lower barrier to entry, faster iteration

---

### 2. Connect — Capabilities

**Icon idea:** Plug / connector / puzzle piece

**Message:** Plug agents into your systems—Jira, databases, knowledge bases, any tool.

**Why it matters:**
- Agents aren't isolated—they work with your existing infrastructure
- Pre-built connectors for common tools
- Add new connections without changing agents
- Your data stays in your systems

---

### 3. Coordinate — Orchestration

**Icon idea:** Network / hierarchy / conductor

**Message:** Agents start sub-agents, wait for results, resume where they left off.

**Why it matters:**
- Complex tasks break into manageable parts
- Parent agents delegate and coordinate
- Work continues even after interruptions
- No lost progress, no manual handover

---

### 4. Share — Context Store

**Icon idea:** Folder / share symbol / handshake

**Message:** Share context efficiently—no repeated work, no wasted tokens.

**Why it matters:**
- Agents pass references, not full documents
- Knowledge transfers without copy-paste
- Reduces AI costs (smaller context windows)
- Clean handover between agents

---

### 5. Monitor — Visibility

**Icon idea:** Eye / dashboard / pulse line

**Message:** See what every agent is doing—real-time progress and results.

**Why it matters:**
- No black boxes—full transparency
- Catch issues early
- Track performance and costs
- Build trust with stakeholders

---

### 6. Choose — Provider Freedom

**Icon idea:** Switch / arrows / freedom bird

**Message:** Switch AI providers without rewriting—protect your investment.

**Why it matters:**
- Not locked to one vendor
- Choose the best AI for each task
- Negotiate better pricing
- Future-proof against market changes

## Visual Description

**Layout:** Six boxes/cards arranged in a 2x3 or 3x2 grid, or a hexagonal arrangement around a center

**Design Option A — Grid Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Option B — Hexagonal/Circular:**
```
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │ DEFINE  │
                    └────┬────┘
                         │
        ┌─────────┐      │      ┌─────────┐
        │ CHOOSE  │──────●──────│ CONNECT │
        └─────────┘    CENTER   └─────────┘
                      (logo?)
        ┌─────────┐      │      ┌─────────┐
        │ MONITOR │──────┴──────│COORDINATE│
        └─────────┘             └─────────┘
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │  SHARE  │
                    └─────────┘
```

**Visual Style:**
- Each pillar gets its own card/box with subtle glow
- Consistent icon style (line icons, not emoji—emoji shown here for concept only)
- Each card has: Icon + Word + One-line description
- Dark background, light cards with colored accents
- Consider different accent colors for each pillar, or one unified accent

**Color suggestion (if using different colors):**
- Define: Blue (creative, content)
- Connect: Green (integration, systems)
- Coordinate: Purple (orchestration, AI)
- Share: Teal (data, flow)
- Monitor: Amber (visibility, alerts)
- Choose: Orange (freedom, flexibility)

## Presenter Notes

**Opening line:** "Before I show you how easy it is to start, let me give you the big picture. What does this framework actually cover?"

**Walk through each pillar briefly:**
1. "Define: You describe what agents do in plain language. No coding."
2. "Connect: Agents plug into your existing systems—Jira, databases, whatever you use."
3. "Coordinate: Agents can start other agents and wait for results. Complex tasks, simple management."
4. "Share: Agents share context efficiently. No wasted work, no wasted costs."
5. "Monitor: You see everything in real-time. No black boxes."
6. "Choose: You're not locked to one AI provider. We can switch without rewriting."

**Closing line:** "Six capabilities, one integrated platform. Now let me show you how simple it is to use."

## Slide Position

This slide should be **Slide 0** or the **opening slide**—before "The Starting Point." It sets the stage by showing the scope of what we built, then the following slides show how to use it.

**New slide order:**
1. What It Covers (this slide) — "Here's the scope"
2. The Starting Point — "Here's how simple it is"
3. From Laptop to Customer — "Here's how far it goes"
4. Start Fast, Get Efficient — "Here's why it keeps improving"
