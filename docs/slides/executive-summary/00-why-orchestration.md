# Slide: Why Orchestration?

## Title
**"One AI is Good. A Team is Better."**

## Subtitle
"What if your AI assistant could delegate?"

## Key Message
A single AI agent doing everything becomes overwhelmed. Orchestration enables delegation to specialists—same tasks, done in parallel, by focused agents, under control.

## Visual Description

**Layout:** Before/After transformation with arrow in the middle

### Left Side: Without Orchestration
- Single agent (purple box) surrounded by floating task bubbles
- Tasks: Research, Write docs, Review code, Test, Deploy, Analyze, Report, Plan
- Stress indicator (red warning icon) showing overload
- Metrics below: Sequential execution, Overloaded context

### Right Side: With Orchestration
- Central orchestrator (green circle) in the middle
- Four specialist agents orbiting around:
  - Research (blue)
  - Code (purple)
  - Docs (cyan)
  - Test (amber)
- Dashed circle connecting them
- Metrics below: Parallel execution, Focused specialists

### Center: Transformation Arrow
- Arrow pointing from chaos to harmony
- Label: "Orchestrate"

### Bottom: Insight Box
- "The same tasks. **Done in parallel. By specialists. Under control.**"

## The Problem Visualized

| Without Orchestration | With Orchestration |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| One agent, many tasks | Coordinator + specialists |
| Sequential execution | Parallel execution |
| Context overload | Focused context per agent |
| Single point of failure | Distributed work |

## Why This Slide First

This slide answers the foundational question: **Why do we need orchestration at all?**

Before showing the framework's features, we show the problem it solves. The visual transformation makes it immediately clear that orchestration is about delegation and specialization—not just running more agents.
