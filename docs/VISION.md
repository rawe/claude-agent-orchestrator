# Vision

## Purpose

Building agentic tools requires reinventing infrastructure every time. Teams need a foundation that handles orchestration, execution, and integration - so they can focus on their specific use case.

Agent Orchestrator provides this reusable core.

## Core Pillars

### Reusable Foundation
A core framework for building agentic tools without starting from scratch. Works for POCs and production.

**Status:** Implemented

### Progressive Refinement
Start with simple agents, iteratively break them into specialized, orchestrated ones. A process for refining ideas - not just running them.

**Status:** Implemented

### Hybrid Execution
Bridge between AI agents (prompt-based) and deterministic agents (structured I/O). Seamless handoff between both worlds, closing the abstraction gap between natural language and structured data.

**Status:** Next Priority

### Clean Interfaces
Uniform, easy-to-use connection points for external systems. Simple integration patterns that are easy to adapt and plug into.

**Status:** Implemented

### Provider Independence
No vendor lock-in to specific AI providers. Agent runners abstract the underlying AI provider, enabling flexibility without over-abstracting.

**Status:** Implemented

### Decentralized Collaboration
Distributed agent runners contribute specialized agents to a shared network. Team members across machines can provide agents and access shared orchestration.

**Status:** Early Vision

## Current Focus

The immediate priority is **Hybrid Execution** - creating the bridge between AI agents and deterministic agents. This enables structured data flow, cleaner external service integration, and lays the groundwork for knowledge management.

## Long-term Vision

A unified knowledge hub where all project disciplines - designers, developers, PMs, product owners - contribute and collaborate through specialized agents. Programmers build capabilities (MCP servers, skills), while domain experts describe agents and add requirements. The knowledge base covers all dimensions of a project, accessible to everyone, not just programmers.
